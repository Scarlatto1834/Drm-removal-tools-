Description:

    Anti-debug protections are stripped and XLive is rendered useless, thus allowing developers to now easily analyze the Halo 2 for Windows Vista.


Usage:

    Copy xlive.dll into the Halo 2 Vista directory, where halo2.exe is. Start the game!

    Listener, Rick, and Seemaan. I don't know any of them, but Listeners GTA IV wrapper helped me and me for reversing the rest of the exports and stripping unneeded ones.
