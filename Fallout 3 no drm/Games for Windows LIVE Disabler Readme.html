<br>
v1.2.2
<br>
By <a href="mailto:quarny@gmail.com">Quarn</a></p>
<br><br>

This program allows you to do the following to Games for Windows LIVE in Fallout 3: 
<ul>
<li>Stop Games for Windows LIVE from running in Fallout 3 and prevent its dll files from loading which reduces the time it takes for Fallout 3 to startup.
<li>Remove the "LIVE" button at the main menu.
<li>Allow you to bind the "Home" key to whatever action you want.
<li>Allow you to move all of your DLC's out of their "hidden" G4WL folder and into your Fallout 3 folder.
</ul>



<br><br><br><p class="heading"><a>Important Notes\Issues</a></p>
<ul>
<li>This will work with Fallout 3 v1.0 or higher.
<li>If you disable Games for Windows LIVE and actually use it then all your saves will disappear, you can find them in your <b>\My Documents\My Games\Fallout3\Saves\[name]</b> simply move them to the Saves folder.
<li>When G4WL is disabled any DLC's you have will cease to function so use the "Move DLC's" button to get your DLC's working again. 
</ul>

<br><br><br><p class="heading"><a>Thanks</a></p>
<br><b>Timeslip</b> - for permission to use his fake xlive.dll.
<br><b>DarN</b> - for the xml code to remove the "LIVE" button from the Fallout 3's menus.
<br><br>

<br><br><p class="heading"><a>Version History</a></p>
<p class="change"><b>v1.2.2 (08\05\2009)</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The fake xlive.dll will no longer be installed if Fallout 3 v1.0 is detected as it causes the game to freeze on exit.
<li>Fixed *.bik files being placed into \Fallout 3\Data\ instead of \Fallout 3\Data\Video\, if you already run "Move DLC's" with Broken Steel simply move all *.bik's form your Data folder to your Video folder.
</ul>

<p class="change"><b>v1.2.1 (06\05\2009)</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Binding an action to the "Home" key will no longer reset other bindings on that action.
<li>start_menu.xml is no longer in a BSA again (G4WLD.bsa) due to the "LIVE" button sometimes reappearing.
<li>Added support for moving *.bik files out of the hidden G4WL folder (Broken Steel has *.bik's).
</ul>

<p class="change"><b>v1.2.0 (25\04\2009)</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Gave Games for Windows LIVE Disabler a more appropriate icon.
<li>Improved the UI.
<li>Games for Windows LIVE Disabler will now request administrator rights to run.
<li>You'll now be able to point Games for Windows LIVE Disabler to your My Documents folder if it cannot detect it.
<li>Fixed an instance where G4WL would appear disabled when in fact it wasn't.
<li>Fixed all the Home key binding actions (except Forward) not binding to the correct action (oops!).
<li>Prevented Games for Windows LIVE Disabler from running if Fallout 3\G.E.C.K\FO3Edit are running.
<li>Fixed a few typos.
<li>New Feature: you can now move all of the DLC's out of their "hidden" G4WL folder into your Fallout 3 folder, they'll also be automatically activated for your convenience.
<li>Intergrated help (Games for Windows LIVE Disabler Readme.html) into the program, new "Help" button.
<li>Enable\Disable buttons are now greyed out and a warning is displayed if something else disabled G4WL and Games for Windows LIVE Disabler cannot enable\disable G4WL because of it.
<li>You can now bind the "Home" key to open\close the Pip-Boy, seems the Pip-Boy rebinding bug was an undocumented fix of the official patch v1.1.
</ul>
